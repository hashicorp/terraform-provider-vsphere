  Provides a vSphere virtual disk resource.  This can be used to create and delete virtual disks.

# vsphere_virtual_disk

The `vsphere_virtual_disk` resource can be used to create virtual disks outside
of any given [`vsphere_virtual_machine`][docs-vsphere-virtual-machine]
resource. These disks can be attached to a virtual machine by creating a disk
block with the [`attach`][docs-vsphere-virtual-machine-disk-attach] parameter.

[docs-vsphere-virtual-machine]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html
[docs-vsphere-virtual-machine-disk-attach]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html#attach

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc-01"
}

data "vsphere_datacenter" "datastore" {
  name = "datastore-01"
}

resource "vsphere_virtual_disk" "virtual_disk" {
  size               = 40
  type               = "thin"
  vmdk_path          = "/foo/foo.vmdk"
  create_directories = true
  datacenter         = data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.name
  datastore          = data.vsphere_datastore.datastore.name
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

~> **NOTE:** Some fields in the `vsphere_virtual_disk` resource are currently
immutable and force a new resource if changed.

* `vmdk_path` - (Required) The path, including filename, of the virtual disk to
  be created.  This needs to end in `.vmdk`.
* `datastore` - (Required) The name of the datastore in which to create the
  disk.
* `size` - (Required) Size of the disk (in GB). Decreasing the size of a disk is not possible.
If a disk of a smaller size is required then the original has to be destroyed along with its data and a new one has to be
created.
* `datacenter` - (Optional) The name of the datacenter in which to create the
  disk. Can be omitted when ESXi or if there is only one datacenter in
  your infrastructure.
* `type` - (Optional) The type of disk to create. Can be one of
  `eagerZeroedThick`, `lazy`, or `thin`. Default: `eagerZeroedThick`. For
  information on what each kind of disk provisioning policy means, click
  [here][docs-vmware-vm-disk-provisioning].

[docs-vmware-vm-disk-provisioning]: https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/8-0/vsphere-single-host-management-vmware-host-client-8-0/virtual-machine-management-with-the-vsphere-host-client-vSphereSingleHostManagementVMwareHostClient/configuring-virtual-machines-in-the-vsphere-host-client-vSphereSingleHostManagementVMwareHostClient/virtual-disk-configuration-vSphereSingleHostManagementVMwareHostClient/about-virtual-disk-provisioning-policies-vSphereSingleHostManagementVMwareHostClient.html

* `adapter_type` - (Optional) The adapter type for this virtual disk. Can be
  one of `ide`, `lsiLogic`, or `busLogic`.  Default: `lsiLogic`.

~> **NOTE:** `adapter_type` is **deprecated**: it does not dictate the type of
controller that the virtual disk will be attached to on the virtual machine.
Please see the [`scsi_type`][docs-vsphere-virtual-machine-scsi-type] parameter
in the `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource for information on how to control
disk controller types. This parameter will be removed in future versions of the
vSphere provider.

[docs-vsphere-virtual-machine-scsi-type]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html#scsi_type

* `create_directories` - (Optional) Tells the resource to create any
  directories that are a part of the `vmdk_path` parameter if they are missing.
  Default: `false`.

~> **NOTE:** Any directory created as part of the operation when
`create_directories` is enabled will not be deleted when the resource is
destroyed.

## Importing

An existing virtual disk can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource
via supplying the full datastore path to the virtual disk. An example is below:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import vsphere_virtual_disk.virtual_disk \
  '{"virtual_disk_path": "/dc-01/[datastore-01]foo/bar.vmdk", \ "create_directories": "true"}'
```

The above would import the virtual disk located at `foo/bar.vmdk` in the `datastore-01`
datastore of the `dc-01` datacenter with `create_directories` set as `true`.

~> **NOTE:** Import is not supported if using the **deprecated** `adapter_type` field.
