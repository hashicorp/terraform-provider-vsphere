# vsphere\_supervisor

Provides a resource for configuring Workload Management.

## Example Usages

**Enable Workload Management on a compute cluster**

```hcl
resource "vsphere_virtual_machine_class" "vm_class" {
  name = "custom-class"
  cpus = 4
  memory = 4096
}

resource "vsphere_supervisor" "supervisor" {
  cluster = "<compute_cluster_id>"
  storage_policy = "<storage_policy_name>"
  content_library = "<content_library_id>"
  main_dns = "10.0.0.250"
  worker_dns = "10.0.0.250"
  edge_cluster = "<edge_cluster_id>"
  dvs_uuid = "<distributed_switch_uuid>"
  sizing_hint = "MEDIUM"

  management_network {
    network = "<portgroup_id>"
    subnet_mask = "255.255.255.0"
    starting_address = "10.0.0.150"
    gateway = "10.0.0.250"
    address_count = 5
  }

  ingress_cidr {
    address = "10.10.10.0"
    prefix = 24
  }

  egress_cidr {
    address = "10.10.11.0"
    prefix = 24
  }

  pod_cidr {
    address = "10.244.10.0"
    prefix = 23
  }

  service_cidr {
    address = "10.10.12.0"
    prefix = 24
  }

  search_domains = [ "vsphere.local" ]

  namespace {
    name = "custom-namespace"
    content_libraries = []
    vm_clases = [ "${vsphere_virtual_machine_class.vm_class.id}" ]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `cluster` - The identifier of the compute cluster.
* `storage_policy` - The name of the storage policy.
* `management_network` - The configuration for the management network which the control plane VMs will be connected to.
* * `network` - ID of the network. (e.g. a distributed port group).
* * `starting_address` - Starting address of the management network range.
* * `subnet_mask` - Subnet mask.
* * `gateway` - Gateway IP address.
* * `address_count` - Number of addresses to allocate. Starts from `starting_address`
* `content_library` - The identifier of the subscribed content library.
* `main_dns` - The list of addresses of the primary DNS servers.
* `worker_dns` - The list of addresses of the DNS servers to use for the worker nodes.
* `edge_cluster` - The identifier of the NSX Edge Cluster.
* `dvs_uuid` - The UUID of the distributed switch.
* `sizing_hint` - The size of the Kubernetes API server.
* `egress_cidr` - CIDR blocks from which NSX assigns IP addresses used for performing SNAT from container IPs to external IPs.
* `ingress_cidr` - CIDR blocks from which NSX assigns IP addresses for Kubernetes Ingresses and Kubernetes Services of type LoadBalancer.
* `pod_cidr` - CIDR blocks from which Kubernetes allocates pod IP addresses. Minimum subnet size is 23.
* `service_cidr` - CIDR block from which Kubernetes allocates service cluster IP addresses.
* `search_domains` - List of DNS search domains.
* `namespace` - The list of namespaces to create in the Supervisor cluster

### Namespace schema

* `name` - The name of the namespace
* `content_libraries` - The list of content libraries to associate with the namespace
* `vm_classes` - The list of virtual machine classes to add to the namespace
