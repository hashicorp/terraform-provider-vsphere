# vsphere\_role

The `vsphere_role` resource can be used to create and manage roles. Using this resource, privileges can be 
associated with the roles. The role can be used while granting permissions to an entity.

## Example Usage

This example creates a role with name my_terraform_role and privileges create, acknowledge for Alarm and 
create, move for Datacenter. While providing `role_privileges`, the id of the privilege has to be provided.
The format of the privilege id is privilege name preceded by its categories joined by a `.`.
For example a privilege with path `category->subcategory->privilege` should be provided as 
`category.subcategory.privilege`. Keep the `role_privileges` sorted alphabetically for a better user experience.

~> **NOTE:** While providing `role_privileges`, the id of the privilege and its categories are to be provided
joined by a `.` .

```hcl

resource vsphere_role "role1" {
  name = "my_terraform_role"
  role_privileges = ["Alarm.Acknowledge", "Alarm.Create", "Datacenter.Create", "Datacenter.Move"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the role.
* `role_privileges` - (Optional) The privileges to be associated with this role.
