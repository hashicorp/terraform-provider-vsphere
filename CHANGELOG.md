## v2.1.1

> Release Date: 2022-03-08

**If you are using v2.1.0, please upgrade to this new version as soon as possible.**

BUG FIX:

- `r/compute_cluster`: Reverts (#1432) switching `vsan_disk_group` back to `TypeList`. Switching from `TypeList` to `TypeSet` is a sore spot when it comes to what is considered a breaking change to provider configuration. Generally we accept that users may use list indices within their config. When this attribute switched to `TypeSet` this caused a breaking change for configurations doing that, as `TypeSet` is indexed by a hash value that Terraform calculates. Furthermore other code around type assertions was not changed and this attribute actually crashed the provider in `v2.1.0`, we will address the now re-opened (#1205) in `v3.0.0` of the provider. (#1615)

FEATURES:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Added support to check the power state of the resource. (#1407)

> Release Date: 2022-02-28

BUG FIX:

- `r/compute_cluster`: Updated `ha_datastore_apd_response_delay` to the API default (180) for `vmTerminateDelayForAPDSec`. Previously set to 3 (minutes) however the codebase uses this value as seconds. Users who had the field left blank may see a warning about the state value drifting from 3 to 180, after applying this should go away. (#1542)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Don't read `storage_policy_id` if vCenter is not configured. This is not a scenario we test or support explicitly (#1408)
- `d/virtual_machine`: Fixed silent failure and add `default_ip_address` attribute. (#1532)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed race condition by always forcing a new datastore id. (#1486)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed default guest OS identifier. (#1543)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Updated `windows_options` to ensure all required options for domain join are provided (#1562)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed migration of all disks and configuration files when the datastore_cluster_id is changed on the resource. (#1546)
- `r/file`: Fixed upload of VMDK to datastore on ESXi host. (#1409)
- `r/tag`: Fixed deletion detection in `tag` and `tag_category`. (#1579)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Sets `annotation` to optional + computed. (#1588)

FEATURES:

- `d/license`: New datasource can be used to read general attributes of a license. (#1580)

- **New Resource:** `vsphere_datastore_cluster` (#436)
- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_datastore_cluster` (#437)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- The provider now has the ability to persist sessions to disk, which can help when running large amounts of consecutive or concurrent Terraform operations at once. See the [provider documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vsphere/index.html) for more details. (#422)
- `r/virtual_machine`: This resource now supports import of resources or migrations from legacy versions of the provider (provider version 0.4.2 or earlier) into configurations that have the `clone` block specified. See [Additional requirements and notes for importing](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html#additional-requirements-and-notes-for-importing) in the resource documentation for more details. (#460)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Now supports datastore clusters. Virtual machines placed in a datastore cluster will use Storage DRS recommendations for initial placement, virtual disk creation, and migration between datastore clusters. Migrations made by Storage DRS outside of Terraform will no longer create diffs when datastore clusters are in use. (#447)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Added support for ISO transport of vApp properties. The resource should now behave better with virtual machines cloned from OVF/OVA templates that use the ISO transport to supply configuration settings. (#381)

- `r/virtual_machine`: Corrected an issue reading disk capacity values after a vCenter or ESXi upgrade. (#405)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Opaque networks, such as those coming from NSX, should now be able to be correctly added as networks for virtual machines. (#398)

## v1.3.2

> Release Date: 2018-02-07

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Changed the update implemented in (#377) to use a local filter implementation. This corrects situations where virtual machines in inventory with orphaned or otherwise corrupt configurations were interfering with UUID searches, creating erroneous duplicate UUID errors. This fix applies to Sphere 6.0 and lower only. vSphere 6.5 was not affected. (#391)

## v1.3.1

> Release Date: 2018-02-01

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Looking up templates by their UUID now functions correctly for vSphere 6.0 and earlier. (#377)

## v1.3.0

> Release Date: 2018-01-26

BREAKING CHANGES:

- The `virtual_machine` resource now has a new method of identifying virtual disk sub-resources, via the `label` attribute. This replaces the `name` attribute, which has now been marked as deprecated and will be removed in the next major version (2.0.0). Further to this, there is a `path` attribute that now must also be supplied for external disks. This has lifted several virtual disk-related cloning and migration restrictions, in addition to changing requirements for importing. See the [resource documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html) for usage details.

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed an issue where certain changes happening at the same time (such as a disk resize along with a change of SCSI type) were resulting in invalid device change operations. (#371)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Introduced the `label` argument, which allows one to address a virtual disk independent of its VMDK file name and position on the SCSI bus. (#363)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Introduced the `path` argument, which replaces the `name` attribute for supplying the path for externally attached disks supplied with `attach = true`, and is otherwise a computed attribute pointing to the current path of any specific virtual disk. (#363)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Introduced the `uuid` attribute, a new computed attribute that allows the tracking of a disk independent of its current position on the SCSI bus. This is used in all scenarios aside from freshly-created or added virtual disks. (#363)
- `r/virtual_machine`: The virtual disk `name` argument is now deprecated and will be removed from future releases. It no longer dictates the name of non-attached VMDK files and serves as an alias to the now-split `label` and `path` attributes. (#363)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Cloning no longer requires you to choose a disk label (name) that matches the name of the VM. (#363)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Storage vMotion can now be performed on renamed virtual machines. (#363)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Storage vMotion no longer cares what your disks are labeled (named), and will not block migrations based on the naming criteria added after 1.1.1. (#363)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Storage vMotion now works on linked clones. (#363)
- `r/virtual_machine`: The import restrictions for virtual disks have changed, and rather than ensuring that disk `name` arguments match a certain convention, `label` is now expected to match a convention of `diskN`, where N is the disk number, ordered by the disk's position on the SCSI bus. Importing to a configuration still using `name` to address disks is no longer supported. (#363)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Now supports setting vApp properties that usually come from an OVF/OVA template or virtual appliance. (#303)

## v1.2.0

> Release Date: 2018-01-11

FEATURES:

- **New Resource:** `vsphere_custom_attribute` (#229)
- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_custom_attribute` (#229)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- All vSphere provider resources that are capable of doing so now support custom attributes. Check the documentation of any specific resource for more details! (#229)
- `r/virtual_machine`: The resource will now disallow a disk's `name` coming from a value that is still unavailable at plan time (such as a computed value from a resource). (#329)

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed an issue that was causing crashes when working with virtual machines or templates when no network interface was occupying the first available device slot on the PCI bus. (#344)

## v1.1.1

> Release Date: 2017-12-14

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Network interface resource allocation options are now restricted to Sphere 6.0 and higher, as they are unsupported on vSphere 5.5. (#322)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Resources that were deleted outside of Terraform will now be marked as gone in the state, causing them to be re-created during the next apply. (#321)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Added some restrictions to storage vMotion to cover some currently un-supported scenarios that were still allowed, leading to potentially dangerous situations or invalid post-application states. (#319)
- `r/virtual_machine`: The resource now treats disks that it does not recognize at a known device address as orphaned, and will set `keep_on_remove` to safely remove them. (#317)
- `r/virtual_machine`: The resource now attempts to detect unsafe disk deletion scenarios that can happen from the renaming of a virtual machine in situations where the VM and disk names may share a common variable. The provider will block such operations from proceeding. (#305)

## v1.1.0

> Release Date: 2017-12-07

BREAKING CHANGES:

- The `virtual_machine` _data source_ has a new sub-resource attribute for disk information, named `disks`. This takes the place of `disk_sizes`, which has been moved to a `size` attribute within this new sub-resource, and also contains information about the discovered disks' `eagerly_scrub` and `thin_provisioned` settings. This is to facilitate the ability to discover all settings that could cause issues when cloning virtual machines.

To transition to the new syntax, any `disk` sub-resource in a `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource that depends on a syntax such as:

```hcl
resource "vsphere_virtual_machine" "vm" {
  ...

  disk {
    name = "terraform-test.vmdk"
    size = "${data.vsphere_virtual_machine.template.disk_sizes[0]}"
  }
}
```

Should be changed to:

```hcl
resource "vsphere_virtual_machine" "vm" {
  ...

  disk {
    name = "terraform-test.vmdk"
    size = "${data.vsphere_virtual_machine.template.disks.0.size}"
  }
}
```

If you are using `linked_clone`, add the new settings for `eagerly_scrub` and `thin_provisioned`:

```hcl
resource "vsphere_virtual_machine" "vm" {
  ...

  disk {
    name             = "terraform-test.vmdk"
    size             = "${data.vsphere_virtual_machine.template.disks.0.size}"
    eagerly_scrub    = "${data.vsphere_virtual_machine.template.disks.0.eagerly_scrub}"
    thin_provisioned = "${data.vsphere_virtual_machine.template.disks.0.thin_provisioned}"
  }
}
```

For a more complete example, see the [cloning and customization example](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html#cloning-and-customization-example) in the documentation.

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed a bug with NIC device assignment logic that was causing a crash when adding more than 3 NICs to a VM. (#280)
- `r/virtual_machine`: CDROM devices on cloned virtual machines are now connected properly on power on. (#278)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Tightened the pre-clone checks for virtual disks to ensure that the size and disk types are the same between the template and the created virtual machine's configuration. (#277)

## v1.0.3

> Release Date: 2017-12-06

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed an issue in the post-clone process when a CDROM device exists in configuration. (#276)

## v1.0.2

> Release Date: 2017-12-05

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed issues related to correct processing VM templates with no network interfaces, or fewer network interfaces than the amount that will ultimately end up in configuration. (#269)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Version comparison logic now functions correctly to properly disable certain features when using older versions of vSphere. (#272)

## v1.0.1

> Release Date: 2017-12-02

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Corrected an issue that was preventing the use of this resource on standalone ESXi. (#263)
- `d/resource_pool`: This data source now works as documented on standalone ESXi. (#263)

## v1.0.0

> Release Date: 2017-12-01

BREAKING CHANGES:

- The `virtual_machine` resource has received a major update and change to its interface. See the documentation for the resource for full details, including information on things to consider while migrating the new version of the resource.

FEATURES:

- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_resource_pool` (#244)
- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_datastore` (#244)
- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_virtual_machine` (#244)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `r/virtual_machine`: The distinct VM workflows are now better defined: all cloning options are now contained within a `clone` sub-resource, with customization being a `customize` sub-resource off of that. Absence of the `clone` sub-resource means no cloning or customization will occur. (#244)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Nearly all customization options have now been exposed. Magic values such as hostname and DNS defaults have been removed, with some of these options now being required values depending on the OS being customized. (#244)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Device management workflows have been greatly improved, exposing more options and fixing several bugs. (#244)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Added support for CPU and memory hot-plug. Several other VM reconfiguration operations are also supported while the VM is powered on, guest type and VMware Tools permitting in some cases. (#244)
- `r/virtual_machine`: The resource now supports both host and storage vMotion. Virtual machines can now be moved between hosts, clusters, resource pools, and datastores. Individual disks can be pinned to a single datastore with a VM located in another. (#244)
- `r/virtual_machine`: The resource now supports import. (#244)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Several other minor improvements, see documentation for more details. (#244)

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Several long-standing issues have been fixed, namely surrounding virtual disk and network device management. (#244)
- `r/host_virtual_switch`: This resource now correctly supports a configuration with no NICs. (#256)
- `d/network`: No longer restricted to being used on vCenter. (#248)

## v0.4.2

> Release Date: 2017-10-13

FEATURES:

- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_network` (#201)
- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch` (#170)
- **New Resource:** `vsphere_distributed_port_group` (#189)
- **New Resource:** `vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch` (#188)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `r/virtual_machine`: The customization waiter is now tunable through the `wait_for_customization_timeout` argument. The timeout can be adjusted or the waiter can be disabled altogether. (#199)
- `r/virtual_machine`: `domain` now acts as a default for `dns_suffix` if the latter is not defined, setting the value in `domain` as a search domain in the customization specification. `vsphere.local` is not used as a last resort only. (#185)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Expose the `adapter_type` parameter to allow the control of the network interface type. This is currently restricted to `vmxnet3` and `e1000` but offers more control than what was available before, and more interface types will follow in later versions of the provider. (#193)

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed a regression with network discovery that was causing Terraform to crash while the VM was in a powered-off state. (#198)
- All resources that can use tags will now properly remove their tags completely (or remove any out-of-band added tags) when the `tags` argument is not present in configuration. (#196)

## v0.4.1

> Release Date: 2017-10-02

BUG FIX:

- `r/folder`: Migration of state from a version of this resource before v0.4.0 now works correctly. (#187)

## v0.4.0

> Release Date: 2017-09-29

BREAKING CHANGES:

- The `folder` resource has been re-written, and its configuration is significantly different. See the [resource documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vsphere/r/folder.html) for more details. Existing state will be migrated. (#179)

FEATURES:

- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_tag` (#171)
- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_tag_category` (#167)
- **New Resource:** `vsphere_tag` (#171)
- **New Resource:** `vsphere_tag_category` (#164)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `r/folder`: You can now create any kind of folder with this resource, not just virtual machine folders. (#179)
- `r/folder`: Now supports tags. (#179)
- `r/folder`: Now supports import. (#179)
- `r/datacenter`: Tags can now be applied to datacenters. (#177)
- `r/nas_datastore`: Tags can now be applied to NAS datastores. (#176)
- `r/vmfs_datastore`: Tags can now be applied to VMFS datastores. (#176)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Tags can now be applied to virtual machines. (#175)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Adjusted the customization timeout to 10 minutes (#168)

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: This resource can now be used with networks with unescaped slashes in its network name. (#181)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed a crash where virtual NICs were created with networks backed by a 3rd party hardware VDS. (#181)
- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed crashes and spurious diffs that were caused by errors in the code that associates the default gateway with its correct network device during refresh. (#180)

## v0.3.0

> Release Date: 2017-09-14

BREAKING CHANGES:

- `virtual_machine` now waits on a _routable_ IP address by default, and does not wait when running `terraform plan`, `terraform refresh`, or `terraform destroy`. There is also now a timeout of 5 minutes, after which `terraform apply` will fail with an error. Note that the apply may not fail exactly on the 5-minute mark. The network waiter can be disabled completely by setting `wait_for_guest_net` to `false`. (#158)

FEATURES:

- **New Resource:** `vsphere_virtual_machine_snapshot` (#107)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Virtual machine power state is now enforced. Terraform will trigger a diff if the VM is powered off or suspended, and power it back on during the next apply. (#152)

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Fixed customization behavior to watch customization events for success, rather than returning immediately when the `CustomizeVM` task returns. This is especially important during Windows customization where a large part of the customization task involves out-of-band configuration through Sysprep. (#158)

## v0.2.2

> Release Date: 2017-09-07

FEATURES:

- **New Resource:** `vsphere_nas_datastore` (#149)
- **New Resource:** `vsphere_vmfs_datastore` (#142)
- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_vmfs_disks` (#141)

## v0.2.1

> Release Date: 2017-08-31

FEATURES:

- **New Resource:** `vsphere_host_port_group` (#139)
- **New Resource:** `vsphere_host_virtual_switch` (#138)
- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_datacenter` (#144)
- **New Data Source:** `vsphere_host` (#146)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Allow customization of hostname (#79)

BUG FIX:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Fix IPv4 address mapping issues causing spurious diffs, in addition to IPv6 normalization issues that can lead to spurious diffs as well. (#128)

## v0.2.0

> Release Date: 2017-08-23

BREAKING CHANGES:

- `r/virtual_disk`: Default adapter type is now `lsiLogic`, changed from `ide`. (#94)

FEATURES:

- **New Resource:** `vsphere_datacenter` (#126)
- **New Resource:** `vsphere_license` (#110)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `r/virtual_machine`: Add annotation argument (#111)

BUG FIX:

- Updated [govmomi](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi) to 0.15.0 (#114)
- Updated network interface discovery behavior in refresh. (#129). This fixed several reported bugs - see the PR for references!

## v0.1.0

> Release Date: 2017-06-20

NOTES:

- Same functionality as that of Terraform 0.9.8. Repacked as part of [Provider Splitout](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/upcoming-provider-changes-in-terraform-0-10/)
