# Terraform vSphere Provider

This is the repository for the Terraform vSphere Provider, which one can use
with Terraform to work with VMware vSphere Products, notably [vCenter Server][1]
and [ESXi][2].

[2]: https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html

Coverage is currently only limited to a few resources namely surrounding virtual
machines, but in the coming months we are planning release coverage for most
essential vSphere workflows, including working with storage and networking
components such as datastores, and standard and distributed vSwitches. Watch
this space!

For general information about Terraform, visit the [official website][3] and the
[GitHub project page][4].

# Using the Provider

The current version of this provider requires Terraform v0.10.2 or higher to
run.

Note that you need to run `terraform init` to fetch the provider before
deploying. Read about the provider split and other changes to TF v0.10.0 in the
official release announcement found [here][4].

## Full Provider Documentation

The provider is documented in full on the Terraform website and can be found
[here][5]. Check the provider documentation for details on entering your
connection information and how to get started with writing configuration for
vSphere resources.

### Controlling the provider version

Note that you can also control the provider version. This requires the use of a
`provider` block in your Terraform configuration if you have not added one
already.

The syntax is as follows:

```hcl
provider "vsphere" {
  version = "~> 0.2"
  ...
}
```

Version locking uses a pessimistic operator, so this version lock would mean
anything within the 0.2.x namespace. [Read more][6] on provider version control.

# Building The Provider

**NOTE:** Unless you are [developing][7] or require a pre-release bugfix or feature,
you will want to use the officially released version of the provider (see [the
section above][8]).

## Cloning the Project

First, you will want to clone the repository to
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vsphere`:

```sh
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vsphere
```

## Running the Build

After the clone has been completed, you can enter the provider directory and
build the provider.

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vsphere
make build
```

## Installing the Local Plugin

After the build is complete, copy the `terraform-provider-vsphere` binary into
the same path as your `terraform` binary, and re-run `terraform init`.

After this, your project-local `.terraform/plugins/ARCH/lock.json` (where `ARCH`
matches the architecture of your machine) file should contain a SHA256 sum that
matches the local plugin. Run `shasum -a 256` on the binary to verify the values
match.

# Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go][9] installed on your
machine (version 1.8+ is **required**). You'll also need to correctly setup a
[GOPATH][10], as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

See [Building the Provider][11] for details on building the provider.

# Testing the Provider

**NOTE:** Testing the vSphere provider is currently a complex operation as it
requires having a vCenter endpoint to test against, which should be hosting a
standard configuration for a vSphere cluster. Some of the tests will work
against ESXi, but YMMV.

## Configuring Environment Variables

Most of the tests in this provider require a comprehensive list of environment
variables to run. See the individual `*_test.go` files in the
[`vsphere/`](vsphere/) directory for more details. The next section also
describes how you can manage a configuration file of the test environment
variables.

### Using the `.tf-vsphere-devrc.mk` file

The [`tf-vsphere-devrc.mk.example`](tf-vsphere-devrc.mk.example) file contains
an up-to-date list of environment variables required to run the acceptance
tests. Copy this to `$HOME/.tf-vsphere-devrc.mk` and change the permissions to
something more secure (ie: `chmod 600 $HOME/.tf-vsphere-devrc.mk`), and
configure the variables accordingly.

## Running the Acceptance Tests

After this is done, you can run the acceptance tests by running:

```sh
$ make testacc
```

If you want to run against a specific set of tests, run `make testacc` with the
`TESTARGS` parameter containing the run mask as per below:

```sh
make testacc TESTARGS="-run=TestAccVSphereVirtualMachine"
```

This following example would run all of the acceptance tests matching
`TestAccVSphereVirtualMachine`. Change this for the specific tests you want to
run.
