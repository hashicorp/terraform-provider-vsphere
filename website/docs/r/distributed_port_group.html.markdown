  Provides a vSphere distributed virtual portgroup resource. This can be used to create and manage portgroups on a distributed virtual switch.
---

# vsphere\_distributed\_port\_group

The `vsphere_distributed_port_group` resource can be used to manage vSphere
distributed virtual port groups. These port groups are connected to distributed
virtual switches, which can be managed by the
[`vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch`][distributed-virtual-switch] resource.

Distributed port groups can be used as networks for virtual machines, allowing
VMs to use the networking supplied by a distributed virtual switch (DVS), with
a set of policies that apply to that individual newtork, if desired.

For an overview on vSphere networking concepts, see [this
page][ref-vsphere-net-concepts]. For more information on vSphere DVS
portgroups, see [this page][ref-vsphere-dvportgroup].

~> **NOTE:** This resource requires vCenter and is not available on direct ESXi
connections.

## Example Usage

The configuration below builds on the example given in the
[`vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch`][distributed-virtual-switch] resource by
adding the `vsphere_distributed_port_group` resource, attaching itself to the
DVS created here and assigning VLAN ID 1000.

```hcl
variable "esxi_hosts" {
  default = [
    "esxi1",
    "esxi2",
    "esxi3",
  ]
}

variable "network_interfaces" {
  default = [
    "vmnic0",
    "vmnic1",
    "vmnic2",
    "vmnic3",
  ]
}

data "vsphere_datacenter" "dc" {
  name = "dc1"
}

data "vsphere_host" "host" {
  count         = "${length(var.esxi_hosts)}"
  name          = "${var.esxi_hosts[count.index]}"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.dc.id}"
}

resource "vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch" "dvs" {
  name          = "terraform-test-dvs"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.dc.id}"

  uplinks         = ["uplink1", "uplink2", "uplink3", "uplink4"]
  active_uplinks  = ["uplink1", "uplink2"]
  standby_uplinks = ["uplink3", "uplink4"]

  host {
    host_system_id = "${data.vsphere_host.host.0.id}"
    devices        = ["${var.network_interfaces}"]
  }

  host {
    host_system_id = "${data.vsphere_host.host.1.id}"
    devices        = ["${var.network_interfaces}"]
  }

  host {
    host_system_id = "${data.vsphere_host.host.2.id}"
    devices        = ["${var.network_interfaces}"]
  }
}

resource "vsphere_distributed_port_group" "pg" {
  name                            = "terraform-test-pg"
  distributed_virtual_switch_uuid = "${vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch.dvs.id}"

  vlan_id = 1000
}
```

### Overriding DVS policies

All of the [default port policies][dvs-default-port-policies] available in the
`vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch` resource can be overridden on the port
group level by specifying new settings for them.

[dvs-default-port-policies]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/distributed_virtual_switch.html#default-port-group-policy-arguments

As an example, we also take this example from the
`vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch` resource where we manually specify our
uplink count and uplink order. While the DVS has a default policy of using the
first uplink as an active uplink and the second one as a standby, the
overridden port group policy means that both uplinks will be used as active
uplinks in this specific port group.

```hcl
resource "vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch" "dvs" {
  name          = "terraform-test-dvs"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.dc.id}"

  uplinks         = ["tfup1", "tfup2"]
  active_uplinks  = ["tfup1"]
  standby_uplinks = ["tfup2"]
}

resource "vsphere_distributed_port_group" "pg" {
  name                            = "terraform-test-pg"
  distributed_virtual_switch_uuid = "${vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch.dvs.id}"

  vlan_id = 1000

  active_uplinks  = ["tfup1", "tfup2"]
  standby_uplinks = []
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the port group.
* `distributed_virtual_switch_uuid` - (Required) The ID of the DVS to add the
  port group to. Forces a new resource if changed.
* `type` - (Optional) The port group type. Can be one of `earlyBinding` (static
  binding) or `ephemeral`. Default: `earlyBinding`.
* `description` - (Optional) An optional description for the port group.
* `number_of_ports` - (Optional) The number of ports available on this port
  group. Cannot be decreased below the amount of used ports on the port group.
* `auto_expand` - (Optional) Allows the port group to create additional ports
  past the limit specified in `number_of_ports` if necessary. Default: `true`.

~> **NOTE:** Using `auto_expand` with a statically defined `number_of_ports`
may lead to errors when the port count grows past the amount specified.  If you
specify `number_of_ports`, you may wish to set `auto_expand` to `false`.

* `port_name_format` - (Optional) An optional formatting policy for naming of
  the ports in this port group. See the `portNameFormat` attribute listed
  [here][ext-vsphere-portname-format] for details on the format syntax.

[ext-vsphere-portname-format]: https://code.vmware.com/apis/196/vsphere#/doc/vim.dvs.DistributedVirtualPortgroup.ConfigInfo.html#portNameFormat

* `network_resource_pool_key` - (Optional) The key of a network resource pool
  to associate with this port group. The default is `-1`, which implies no
  association.
* `custom_attributes` (Optional) Map of custom attribute ids to attribute
  value string to set for port group. See [here][docs-setting-custom-attributes] 
  for a reference on how to set values for custom attributes.

[docs-setting-custom-attributes]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/custom_attribute.html#using-custom-attributes-in-a-supported-resource

~> **NOTE:** Custom attributes are unsupported on direct ESXi connections 
and require vCenter.

### Policy options

In addition to the above options, you can configure any policy option that is
available under the [`vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch` policy
options][dvs-default-port-policies] section. Any policy option that is not set
is inherited from the DVS, its options propagating to the port group.

See the link for a full list of options that can be set.

### Port override options

The following options below control whether or not the policies set in the port
group can be overridden on the individual port:

* `block_override_allowed` - (Optional) Allow the [port shutdown
  policy][port-shutdown-policy] to be overridden on an individual port.
* `live_port_moving_allowed` - (Optional) Allow a port in this port group to be
  moved to another port group while it is connected.
* `netflow_override_allowed` - (Optional) Allow the [Netflow
  policy][netflow-policy] on this port group to be overridden on an individual
  port.
* `network_resource_pool_override_allowed` - (Optional) Allow the network
  resource pool set on this port group to be overridden on an individual port.
* `port_config_reset_at_disconnect` - (Optional) Reset a port's settings to the
  settings defined on this port group policy when the port disconnects.
* `security_policy_override_allowed` - (Optional) Allow the [security policy
  settings][sec-policy-settings] defined in this port group policy to be
  overridden on an individual port.
* `shaping_override_allowed` - (Optional) Allow the [traffic shaping
  options][traffic-shaping-settings] on this port group policy to be overridden
  on an individual port.
* `traffic_filter_override_allowed` - (Optional) Allow any traffic filters on
  this port group to be overridden on an individual port.
* `uplink_teaming_override_allowed` - (Optional) Allow the [uplink teaming
  options][uplink-teaming-settings] on this port group to be overridden on an
  individual port.
* `vlan_override_allowed` - (Optional) Allow the [VLAN settings][vlan-settings]
  on this port group to be overridden on an individual port.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id`: The [managed object reference ID][docs-about-morefs] of the created
  port group.
* `key`: The generated UUID of the portgroup.

[docs-about-morefs]: /docs/providers/vsphere/index.html#use-of-managed-object-references-by-the-vsphere-provider

~> **NOTE:** While `id` and `key` may look the same in state, they are
documented differently in the vSphere API and come from different fields in the
port group object. If you are asked to supply an [managed object reference
ID][docs-about-morefs] to another resource, be sure to use the `id` field.

* `config_version`: The current version of the port group configuration,
  incremented by subsequent updates to the port group.

## Importing

An existing port group can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via
the path to the port group, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html

```
terraform import vsphere_distributed_port_group.pg /dc1/network/pg
```

The above would import the port group named `pg` that is located in the `dc1`
datacenter.
