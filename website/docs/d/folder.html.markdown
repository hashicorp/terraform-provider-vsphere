# vsphere\_folder

The `vsphere_folder` data source can be used to get the general attributes of a
vSphere inventory folder. Paths are absolute and include must include the
datacenter.  

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vsphere_folder" "folder" {
  path = "/dc1/datastore/folder1"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `path` - (Required) The absolute path of the folder. For example, given a
  default datacenter of `default-dc`, a folder of type `vm`, and a folder name
  of `terraform-test-folder`, the resulting path would be
  `/default-dc/vm/terraform-test-folder`. The valid folder types to be used in
  the path are: `vm`, `host`, `datacenter`, `datastore`, or `network`.

## Attribute Reference

The only attribute that this resource exports is the `id`, which is set to the
[managed object ID][docs-about-morefs] of the folder.
