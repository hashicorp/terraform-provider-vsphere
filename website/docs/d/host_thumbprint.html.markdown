# vsphere\_host\_thumbprint

The `vsphere_thumbprint` data source can be used to discover the host
thumbprint of an ESXi host. This can be used when adding the `vsphere_host`
resource. If the ESXi host is using a certificate chain, the first one returned
will be used to generate the thumbprint.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vsphere_host_thumbprint" "thumbprint" {
  address = "esxi-01.example.com"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `address` - (Required) The address of the ESXi host to retrieve the
  thumbprint from.
* `port` - (Optional) The port to use connecting to the ESXi host. Default: 443
* `insecure` - (Optional) Disables SSL certificate verification.
  Default: `false`

## Attribute Reference

The only exported attribute is `id`, which is the thumbprint of the ESXi
host.
