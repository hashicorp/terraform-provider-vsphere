  Provides a vSphere custom attribute data source. This can be used to reference custom attributes not managed in Terraform.
---

# vsphere\_custom\_attribute

The `vsphere_custom_attribute` data source can be used to reference custom 
attributes that are not managed by Terraform. Its attributes are exactly the 
same as the [`vsphere_custom_attribute` resource][resource-custom-attribute], 
and, like importing, the data source takes a name to search on. The `id` and 
other attributes are then populated with the data found by the search.

[resource-custom-attribute]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/custom_attribute.html

~> **NOTE:** Custom attributes are unsupported on direct ESXi connections 
and require vCenter.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vsphere_custom_attribute" "attribute" {
  name = "terraform-test-attribute"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) The name of the custom attribute.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to the `id` being exported, all of the fields that are available in 
the [`vsphere_custom_attribute` resource][resource-custom-attribute] are also 
populated. See that page for further details.
