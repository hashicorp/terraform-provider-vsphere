# vsphere\_host

Provides a VMware vSphere host resource. This represents an ESXi host that
can be used either as a member of a cluster or as a standalone host.

## Example Usages

**Create a standalone host:**

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc-01"
}

resource "vsphere_host" "esx-01" {
  hostname = "esx-01.example.com"
  username   = "root"
  password   = "password"
  license    = "00000-00000-00000-00000-00000"
  datacenter = data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id
}
```

**Create host in a compute cluster:**

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc-01"
}

data "vsphere_compute_cluster" "cluster" {
  name          = "cluster-01"
  datacenter_id = data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id
}

resource "vsphere_host" "esx-01" {
  hostname = "esx-01.example.com"
  username = "root"
  password = "password"
  license  = "00000-00000-00000-00000-00000"
  cluster  = data.vsphere_compute_cluster.cluster.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `hostname` - (Required) FQDN or IP address of the host to be added.
* `username` - (Required) Username that will be used by vSphere to authenticate
  to the host.
* `password` - (Required) Password that will be used by vSphere to authenticate
  to the host.
* `datacenter` - (Optional) The ID of the datacenter this host should
  be added to. This should not be set if `cluster` is set.
* `cluster` - (Optional) The ID of the Compute Cluster this host should
  be added to. This should not be set if `datacenter` is set. Conflicts with:
  `cluster`.
* `cluster_managed` - (Optional) Can be set to `true` if compute cluster
  membership will be managed through the `compute_cluster` resource rather
  than the`host` resource. Conflicts with: `cluster`.
* `thumbprint` - (Optional) Host's certificate SHA-1 thumbprint. If not set the
  CA that signed the host's certificate should be trusted. If the CA is not
  trusted and no thumbprint is set then the operation will fail.
* `license` - (Optional) The license key that will be applied to the host.
  The license key is expected to be present in vSphere.
* `force` - (Optional) If set to `true` then it will force the host to be added,
  even if the host is already connected to a different vCenter Server instance.
  Default is `false`.
* `connected` - (Optional) If set to false then the host will be disconected.
  Default is `false`.
* `maintenance` - (Optional) Set the management state of the host.
  Default is `false`.
* `lockdown` - (Optional) Set the lockdown state of the host. Valid options are
  `disabled`, `normal`, and `strict`. Default is `disabled`.
* `tags` - (Optional) The IDs of any tags to attach to this resource. Please
  refer to the `vsphere_tag` resource for more information on applying
  tags to resources.

~> **NOTE:** Tagging support is not supported on direct ESXi host
connections and require vCenter Server.

* `custom_attributes` - (Optional) A map of custom attribute IDs and string
  values to apply to the resource. Please refer to the
  `vsphere_custom_attributes` resource for more information on applying
  tags to resources.

~> **NOTE:** Custom attributes are not supported on direct ESXi host
connections and require vCenter Server.

## Attribute Reference

* `id` - The ID of the host.

## Importing

An existing host can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource by supplying
the host's ID. An example is below:

[docs-import]: /docs/import/index.html

```
terraform import vsphere_host.esx-01 host-123
```

The above would import the host with ID `host-123`.
