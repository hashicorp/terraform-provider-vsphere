  Provides a vSphere network data source. This can be used to get the general attributes of a vSphere network.
---

# vsphere\_network

The `vsphere_network` data source can be used to discover the ID of a network
in vSphere. This can be any network that can be used as the backing for a
network interface for `vsphere_virtual_machine` or any other vSphere resource
that requires a network. This includes standard (host-based) port groups, DVS
port groups, or opaque networks such as those managed by NSX.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc1"
}

data "vsphere_network" "net" {
  name          = "terraform-test-net"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the network. This can be a name or path.
* `datacenter_id` - (Optional) The [managed object reference
  ID][docs-about-morefs] of the datacenter the network is located in. This can
  be omitted if the search path used in `name` is an absolute path. For default
  datacenters, use the id attribute from an empty `vsphere_datacenter` data
  source.
* `distributed_virtual_switch_uuid` - (Optional) For distributed port group type 
   network objects, the ID of the distributed virtual switch the given port group 
   belongs to. It is useful to differentiate port groups with same name using the 
   Distributed virtual switch ID.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id`: The [managed object ID][docs-about-morefs] of the network in question.
* `type`: The managed object type for the discovered network. This will be one
  of `DistributedVirtualPortgroup` for DVS port groups, `Network` for standard
  (host-based) port groups, or `OpaqueNetwork` for networks managed externally
  by features such as NSX.
