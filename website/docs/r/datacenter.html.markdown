  name       = "my_prod_datacenter"
}
```

**Create datacenter on a subfolder:**

```hcl
resource "vsphere_datacenter" "research_datacenter" {
  name       = "my_research_datacenter"
  folder     = "/research/"
}
```

## Importing 

An existing datacenter can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource
via supplying the full path to the datacenter. An example is below:

[docs-import]: /docs/import/index.html

```
terraform import vsphere_datacenter.dc /dc1
```

The above would import the datacenter named `dc1`.
