  Provides a vSphere distributed switch data source. This can be used to get
  attributes of a the distributed switch.

# vsphere\_distributed\_virtual\_switch

The `vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch` data source can be used to discover
the ID and uplink data of a of a vSphere distributed switch (VDS). This
can then be used with resources or data sources that require a VDS, such as the
[`vsphere_distributed_port_group`][distributed-port-group] resource, for which
an example is shown below.

[distributed-port-group]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/distributed_port_group.html

~> **NOTE:** This data source requires vCenter Server and is not available on
direct ESXi host connections.

## Example Usage

The following example locates a distributed switch named `vds-01`, in the
datacenter `dc-01`. It then uses this distributed switch to set up a
`vsphere_distributed_port_group` resource that uses the first uplink as a
primary uplink and the second uplink as a secondary.

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc-01"
}

data "vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch" "vds" {
  name          = "vds-01"
  datacenter_id = data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id
}

resource "vsphere_distributed_port_group" "dvpg" {
  name                            = "dvpg-01"
  distributed_virtual_switch_uuid = data.vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch.vds.id

  active_uplinks  = [data.vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch.vds.uplinks[0]]
  standby_uplinks = [data.vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch.vds.uplinks[1]]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the VDS. This can be a name or path.
* `datacenter_id` - (Optional) The [managed object reference ID][docs-about-morefs]
  of the datacenter the VDS is located in. This can be omitted if the search
  path used in `name` is an absolute path. For default datacenters, use the `id`
  attribute from an empty `vsphere_datacenter` data source.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id`: The UUID of the vSphere distributed switch.
* `uplinks`: The list of the uplinks on this vSphere distributed switchS, as per the
  [`uplinks`][distributed-virtual-switch-uplinks] argument to the
  [`vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch`][distributed-virtual-switch-resource]
  resource.
