# vsphere_host

Provides a VMware vSphere host resource. This represents an ESXi host that
can be used either as a member of a cluster or as a standalone host.

## Example Usages

**Create a standalone host:**

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc-01"
}

data "vsphere_host_thumbprint" "thumbprint" {
  address  = "esxi-01.example.com"
  insecure = true
}

resource "vsphere_host" "esx-01" {
  hostname   = "esxi-01.example.com"
  username   = "root"
  password   = "password"
  license    = "00000-00000-00000-00000-00000"
  thumbprint = data.vsphere_host_thumbprint.thumbprint.id
  datacenter = data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id
}
```

**Create host in a compute cluster:**

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc-01"
}

data "vsphere_compute_cluster" "cluster" {
  name          = "cluster-01"
  datacenter_id = data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id
}

data "vsphere_host_thumbprint" "thumbprint" {
  address  = "esxi-01.example.com"
  insecure = true
}

resource "vsphere_host" "esx-01" {
  hostname   = "esxi-01.example.com"
  username   = "root"
  password   = "password"
  license    = "00000-00000-00000-00000-00000"
  thumbprint = data.vsphere_host_thumbprint.thumbprint.id
  cluster    = data.vsphere_compute_cluster.cluster.id
  services {
    ntpd {
      enabled     = true
      policy      = "on"
      ntp_servers = ["pool.ntp.org"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `hostname` - (Required) FQDN or IP address of the host to be added.
* `username` - (Required) Username that will be used by vSphere to authenticate
  to the host.
* `password` - (Required) Password that will be used by vSphere to authenticate
  to the host.
* `thumbprint` - (Optional) Host's certificate SHA-1 thumbprint. If not set the
  CA that signed the host's certificate should be trusted. If the CA is not
  trusted and no thumbprint is set then the operation will fail. See data source
  [`vsphere_host_thumbprint`][docs-host-thumbprint-data-source].
* `datacenter` - (Optional) The ID of the datacenter this host should
  be added to. This should not be set if `cluster` is set.
* `cluster` - (Optional) The ID of the Compute Cluster this host should
  be added to. This should not be set if `datacenter` is set. Conflicts with:
  `cluster_managed`.
* `cluster_managed` - (Optional) Can be set to `true` if compute cluster
  membership will be managed through the `compute_cluster` resource rather
  than the`host` resource. Conflicts with: `cluster`.
* `license` - (Optional) The license key that will be applied to the host.
  The license key is expected to be present in vSphere.
* `force` - (Optional) If set to `true` then it will force the host to be added,
  even if the host is already connected to a different vCenter Server instance.
  Default is `false`.
* `connected` - (Optional) If set to false then the host will be disconnected.
  Default is `false`.
* `maintenance` - (Optional) Set the management state of the host.
  Default is `false`.
* `lockdown` - (Optional) Set the lockdown state of the host. Valid options are
  `disabled`, `normal`, and `strict`. Default is `disabled`.
* `tags` - (Optional) The IDs of any tags to attach to this resource. Please
  refer to the `vsphere_tag` resource for more information on applying
  tags to resources.

~> **NOTE:** Tagging support is not supported on direct ESXi host
connections and require vCenter Server.

* `services` - (Optional) Set Services on host, the settings to be set are based on service being set as part of import.
  * `ntpd` service has three settings, `enabled` sets service to running or not running, `policy` sets service based on setting of `on` which sets service to "Start and stop with host", `off` which sets service to "Start and stop manually", `automatic` which sets service to "Start and stop with port usage".

~> **NOTE:** `services` only supports ntpd service today.

* `custom_attributes` - (Optional) A map of custom attribute IDs and string
  values to apply to the resource. Please refer to the
  `vsphere_custom_attributes` resource for more information on applying
  tags to resources.

~> **NOTE:** Custom attributes are not supported on direct ESXi host
connections and require vCenter Server.

## Attribute Reference

* `id` - The ID of the host.

## Importing

An existing host can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource by supplying
the host's ID.

[docs-import]: /docs/import/index.html

Obtain the host's ID using the data source. For example:

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc-01"
}

data "vsphere_host" "host" {
  name          = "esxi-01.example.com"
  datacenter_id = data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id
}

output "host_id" {
  value = data.vsphere_host.host.id
}
```

Next, create a resource configuration, For example:

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc-01"
}

data "vsphere_host_thumbprint" "thumbprint" {
  address  = "esxi-01.example.com"
  insecure = true
}

resource "vsphere_host" "esx-01" {
  hostname   = "esxi-01.example.com"
  username   = "root"
  password   = "password"
  thumbprint = data.vsphere_host_thumbprint.thumbprint.id
  datacenter = data.vsphere_datacenter.datacenter.id
}
```

~> **NOTE:** When you import hosts, all managed settings are returned. Ensure all settings are set correctly in resource. For example:

```hcl
resource "vsphere_host" "esx-01" {
  hostname   = "esxi-01.example.com"
  username   = "root"
  password   = "password"
  license    = "00000-00000-00000-00000-00000"
  thumbprint = data.vsphere_host_thumbprint.thumbprint.id
  cluster    = data.vsphere_compute_cluster.cluster.id
  services {
    ntpd {
      enabled     = true
      policy      = "on"
      ntp_servers = ["pool.ntp.org"]
    }
  }
}
```

All information will be added to the Terraform state after import.

```shell
terraform import vsphere_host.esx-01 host-123
```

The above would import the host `esxi-01.example.com` with the host ID `host-123`.
